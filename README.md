# Flappy-Bird

This is my second game made using Lua and Love2d.

I learned a lot of new concept while making this and it was a bit challenging to make this game.

Topics that I learned while making this Game are adding States to the game, adding an inifnite background/level in the game and also taking mouse inputs
